            Technology has transformed communication by making it faster, more accessible, and more diverse than ever
            before. With the rise of smartphones, social media, and instant messaging platforms, people can connect
            across the globe in real time, breaking down barriers of distance and time. Video calls and collaborative
            tools have also enhanced professional interactions, enabling remote work and international teamwork.
            However, this digital shift has also introduced challenges, such as reduced face-to-face interaction,
            shorter attention spans, and concerns over privacy. Overall, technology has revolutionized how we share
            information and build relationships, creating both opportunities and responsibilities in the way we connect.
